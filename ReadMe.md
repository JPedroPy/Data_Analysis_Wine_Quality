## Analysing Chemical Parameters to Improve the Quality

In this dataset, we have some chemical parameters about types of wine and how they are related with the quality. The parameter are:

- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Type

### Step 1: Importing the dataset
When we have a problem to solve involving a data analysis, the first thing to do is importing the dataset. So, we can use the libraby "pandas" to help us with:

    import pandas as pd
